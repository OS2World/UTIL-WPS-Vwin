          by command.

          The Rexx command file 'vwintest.cmd' provides an example
          of use of vwin.
Use:      To use copy vwin.exe to a directory in your path.
          Source is needed only if you want to re-compile.
          EMX runtime libraries are not required.
To Recompile: Source and makefile in "src" subdirectory.
          CD to that directory and type "make".
          This version was compiled with emx 0.9c on Warp 4.
          Other compilers and or releases may or may not work.

This program is distributed free of charge with no guarantees.
If it doesn't work, I would be interested in hearing from you,
but there is no promise of support.
